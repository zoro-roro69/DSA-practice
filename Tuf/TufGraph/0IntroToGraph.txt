
connected graph
    connected graph is a graph in which from the given node we can reach all other nodes

    example
        1 -- 2 -- 3
                  |
             4 ---

        this is a connected graph if we start from 1 we can reach all the nodes

    
disconnected graph
    a graph is disconnected if from the given node we cannot reach all other nodes

    example

        1--2--3--4      5--6--7     8---9---10

        This is a single graph with 3 connected components

        if we start from 1 then we cannot reach all other nodes, since there is no
        edge between 4 and 5, similarly no edge between 7 and 10
