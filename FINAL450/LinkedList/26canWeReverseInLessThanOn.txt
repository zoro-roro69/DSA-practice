Can we reverse linked list in less than O(n) ?
    for a singly linked list, answer is no we cannot

For doubly linked list ?
    yes we can assuming we have head and tail pointers stored
    we can have a flag set
    if flag is true
        direction of traversal if from head to tail
        we move forward using next pointer and backward using prev pointers
    if flag is false
        we reverse the diection of traversal, now its from tail to head
        in this we move forward using "prev" pointer and move backward using 
        "next" pointer
